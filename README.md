Project Name: Highest-Profit

Description:
This program reads data from a csv, 
prints the amount of data. Then the code
proceeds to only print out the amount of 
valid numerical data and write it to a json 
file. Lastly, the program prints 
top 20 rows with the highest profit
values.

Installation/Running Steps:
Please just clone and run the .bat file.
I hardcoded the information therefore nothing 
is needed other than to run the file.


Background:
I wrote this in the least optimized state 
so that I can talk more about what I would do. 
For example, I would use Pandas. All my internships
used Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and etc. Thus, I 
knew it would be better suited but I wanted to talk 
that in the interview as opposed to starting off that way. 
The way I like to code is with the most primitive/brute force 
answer first before I make it more efficient.

Conclusion:
I really want to work here. And I hope I can convey that
I believe that I am a great candidate for the position. And, I am willing to 
whatever it takes. 

Feedback:
I wanted to do more assessments but I had to 
work overtime at my manager position. However, 
I found all the assessments quite interesting 
and had to think about each of them in depth before 
I chose one. And, I found myself learning and that is 
the coolest thing of all. I never want to stop learning
while coding.
